# Extracting Contours for Analyzing Shape Features in Children's Hand-drawn Shapes

## Introduction

Analyzing children's hand-drawn shapes has significant applications in computer vision, including educational assessment, developmental psychology, and art analysis. By leveraging contours to detect and analyze shape features, we can gain insights into the underlying patterns and characteristics of these drawings. This approach can aid in understanding motor skills, cognitive development, and creativity in children. Additionally, the method can support educators and researchers in evaluating drawing accuracy and complexity. The use of contour analysis provides a non-invasive and efficient tool for assessing developmental milestones through visual inputs.

## Abstract

This project aims to analyze children's hand-drawn shapes using contour detection techniques. Contours are used to extract shape features, enabling the identification and categorization of geometric and irregular shapes. The project employs OpenCV for preprocessing, contour extraction, and feature analysis. Expected outcomes include a robust method for classifying shapes, insights into drawing tendencies, and a platform for further developmental studies. By focusing on contour-based techniques, the project provides a cost-effective and scalable solution for analyzing visual data. The approach emphasizes accuracy and adaptability, making it suitable for diverse applications in education and research.
